## The term of Function Composition
As always, let's get to the point.
> Function Composition is the process of combining several functions to produce a new function.

### Simple example
Look at the example below.
```js
const squareAndDouble = (x) => (x ** 2) * 2;
squareAndDouble(3); // returns 18

// We want to split these operations into 2 pure functions
const square = (x) => x ** 2;
const double = (x) => x * 2;

// Now we can compose these 2 functions to get the same result as squareAndDouble returns
double(square(3)); // returns 18
```

### Let's create a little bit more complex composition.
I would like to create a function that compose all the functions passed to them. 
```js
// This is very common example of function composition
const pipe = (...fns) => value => fns.reduce((acc, fn) => fn(acc), value);

const square = (x) => x ** 2;
const double = (x) => x * 2;
const subtractTwo = (x) => x - 2;

pipe(square, double, subtractTwo, Math.sqrt)(3); // returns 4
// above sequence is: Math.sqrt(((3 ** 2) * 2) - 2)
```
