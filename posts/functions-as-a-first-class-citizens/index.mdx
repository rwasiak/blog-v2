teaser: In this quick note I will explain what means that functions in JavaScript are First-Class Citizens or First-Class Objects.
---
### First-Class Citizen and First-Class Object mean the same.
Both terms concern some functions features in JavaScript. They can be:
* stored in variables
* passed to other functions
* returned from other functions

In one sentence:
> Functions can be treated just like any other variable.

#### Example of storing functions in variables.
```js
const variableWithStoredFunction = () => "I'm returned from function";
variableWithStoredFunction(); // returns "I'm returned from function"
```
You can also store functions in object properties:

```js
const calculator = {
	double: (number) => number * 2,
	triple: (number) => number * 3,
};

calculator.double(4); // returns 8
calculator.triple(5); // returns 15
```

#### Example of passing functions to other functions.
```js
const double = (number) => number * 2;
const logResult = (anyFunction) => console.log(anyFunction(5));
logResult(double); // 10
```

#### Example of returning functions from other functions.
```js
const square = (number) => number ** 2;
const toSquare = () => square;
const countSquare = toSquare();
countSuqre(8); // returns 64
```
