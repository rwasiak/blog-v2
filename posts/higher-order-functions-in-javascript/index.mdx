## The term of Higher-Order Function
Higher-Order Function is a function that operates on other functions. It can:
* taking functions as arguments
* returning functions

It's as simple as that. However, this feature is so powerful.

### Method map as Higher-Order Function.
You may know, that arrays have a method called map - `Array.proptotype.map`
This is a method that creates a new array filled with results of a function called on each element in the calling array. It will be easier to show it on an example.
```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const squares = numbers.map(number => number ** 2); // returns [1, 4, 9, 16]
```
As you can see, we passed a function to the map method which returns squares of each element of the numbers array. We can say that the map method is a Higher Order Function because it takes as an argument other function.

### Method sort as Higher-Order Function.
Sort is another method that can be called on arrays. This method takes as an argument function that defines the sort order.
```js
const unsortedNumbers = [5, 2, 6, 1, 4, 7];
const compareAscending = (a, b) => a - b; // function that defines ascending order
const compareDescending = (b, a) => b - a; // function that defines descending order

const sortedAscending = unsortedNumbers.sort(compareAscending); // returns [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7]
const sortedDescending = unsortedNumbers.sort(compareDescending); // returns [7, 6, 5, 4, 2, 1]
```

### Custom Higher-Order Function
Let's create a Higher-Order Function on our own.
```js
const getExtremum = (extremumFunc) => (...args) => extremumFunc(...args);
const smallestNumber = getExtremum(Math.min)(2, 4, 10, -1); // returns -1
const largestNumber = getExtremum(Math.max)(2, 4, 10, -1); // return 10
```
We've created a function that takes a function as an argument (Math method), then returns this function with another arguments (numbers). If you are astonished by ()() notation, we could write it more imperative, see example below.

```js
const getExtremum = (extremumFunc) => (...args) => extremumFunc(...args);

const getSmallestNumber = getExtremum(Math.min); 
const smallestNumber = getSmallestNumber(2, 4, 10, -1); // returns -1

const getLargestNumber = getExtremum(Math.max);
const largestNumber = getLargestNumber(2, 4, 10, -1); // return 10
```
