## Imperative and declarative programming are two different approaches to writing code. 

Getting straight to the point. 
 > Imperative programming is like **HOW** you do something, when declarative programming is **WHAT** you do something.

### Imperative programming
Imperative programming is about defining a sequence of clear instructions for a computer to perform. This is one of two fundamental programming paradigms in computer science.
Let's see an example.
```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];

const triple = (numArr) => {
	let tripleNumbers = [];
	
	for(i = 0; i < numArr.length; i += 1) {
		tripleNumbers.push(numArr[i] * 3);
	}
	
	return tripleNumbers;
}

triple(numbers); // returns [3, 6, 9, 12]
```

### Declarative programming
Declarative programming is about defining what you want to achive, without clear instructions how to do it. This is the second of two fundamental programming paradigms in computer science.
Look at this very simple example and compare it to example above.
```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];

const triple = (number) => number * 3;
numbers.map(triple); // returns [3, 6, 9, 12]
```

### Advantages of declarative programming
* code can be context-independent
* no side effects
* readability
* more scalable
